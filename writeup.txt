Garrett Bacon Writeup HW #5

For this project, at the moment the website loads with 7 randomized letter graphics in the rack. The graphics are
draggable up to the 7 drop zones I have defined in the board starting from the leftmost point. Each word must start
from the first box on the right and work to the right. To start a new word new deal must be pressed, to reset the game
the reset button must be pressed which will rever the score back to 0. Each letter must be placed one box to the right
of the last letter that was placed or it will return to its original position. The bonus boxes are also functional
as pictured.
